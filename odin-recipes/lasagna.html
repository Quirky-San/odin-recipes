    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna, pasta dish of Italian origin, made with broad often ruffled noodles and a tomato or white sauce. Lasagna, in the singular, is a southern Italian variation of what northern Italians call lasagne, in the plural.</p>
    <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
    <p>Lasagne originated in Italy, in the region of Emilia-Romagna.
        Traditionally, the dough was prepared in Southern Italy with semolina and water and in the northern regions, where semolina was not available, with flour and eggs.
        Originally, in Italy, the word “lasagna” did not refer to a food. The word “lasagna” referred to the pot in which the food was cooked. It is thought that the word “lasagna” for the pot is derived from the Greek word for “chamber pot.
        The earliest lasagna recipes known are dated from the thirteenth century. At that time, tomatoes were not known to Europeans. This means that they couldn’t have used them in the recipes. However, depending on the recipe, different cheeses are used.
        Boiling noodles used to be a requirement for making lasagna. No-boil noodles now exist. These are great as they soften in the oven, but it is absolutely necessary to make sure that there is a great quantity of sauce so the noodles get wet and cook while they are in the oven.
        You can make lasagna in the dish washer. All you have to do is put the ingredients together in a dish (either boils noodles or use the no boil noodles), cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil, then use the heated dry and sanitize cycle on your dishwasher to cook the lasagna.
        The most well-known bit of lasagna lore is probably that the cat, Garfield, from the comic strip, has lasagna as his favorite food.
        Weird Al Yankovic recorded a song called “Lasagna” that is a parody of “La Bamba”.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
            </li>
            <li>1 (24 to 25-ounce) jar marinara sauce (3 cups), such as Rao's or Newman's Own</li>
            <li>12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 3 cups), divided</li>
            <li>15 dry lasagna noodles (not no-boil, about 2/3 of a 1-pound box), divided</li>
            <li>15 to 16 ounces whole-milk ricotta cheese (about 2 cups), divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 400ºF. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400°F.</li>
            <li>Brown the beef and onion. Finely chop 1 medium yellow onion. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch or larger regular or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion, 1 pound lean ground beef, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and cook, breaking the beef up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until the beef is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Prepare the baking dish and assemble the meat sauce. Open 1 (24 to 25-ounce) jar marinara sauce (3 cups). Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir the remaining sauce into the ground beef mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Begin layering the lasagna. Shred 12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese if needed (3 cups). Place 5 lasagna noodles in the baking dish, breaking them if needed to create a single layer (its OK if the noodles overlap slightly). Dollop and spread 1 cup of the ricotta cheese over the noodles. Dollop and spread about 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce on the ricotta, then sprinkle with 1 cup of the mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Continue layering the lasagna. Arrange 5 more noodles over the mozzarella, followed by 1 cup of the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce, and 1 cup of the mozzarella. Top with a final layer of 5 noodles and the remaining sauce, spreading the sauce thin so that it almost completely covers the noodles. (Reserve the remaining 1 cup mozzarella for the end of baking.) Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake the lasagna for 1 hour. Bake for 1 hour. Check to make sure the noodles are done by poking the lasagna with a knife; the knife should slide easily through all the layers. If it doesn't, cover and cook for 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and finish baking. Uncover the lasagna and sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella. Bake uncovered until the mozzarella is melted and lightly browned, and the sauce is bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes more</li>
            <li>Cool the lasagna for 15 minutes. Let the lasagna cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Recipe Notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Make ahead: The lasagna can be assembled and refrigerated up to 2 days in advance, or frozen for up to 1 month. Thaw the frozen lasagna for 2 days in the refrigerator before baking.

            </li>
            <li>Storage: Leftovers can be stored, tightly wrapped, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</li>
